                    <p>
                        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. 
                        Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, 
                        as well as to provide reporting information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, ShareFoods) are called "first-party cookies". 
                        Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". 
                        Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website 
                        (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies 
                        can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

                        for our Platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. 
                        Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Platform. 
                        Third parties serve cookies through our Platform for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
